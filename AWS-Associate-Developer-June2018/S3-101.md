# S3-101

    "Simple Storage Service"
    Object Storage only
    Data is spread over multiple facilities and devices.  Data is highly available.
    0 bytes to 5 TB
    Unlimited storage
    Bucket names must be unique globally.  The S3 namespace is universal.
    E.g. https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acoudguru
    A successful upload into S3 results in a HTTP 200.

## Data Consistency Model
    "Read after Write" consistency for PUTS of new objects.  You can read your file immediately after uploading it!
    "Eventual Consistency" for overwrites of PUTS and DELETES.  

## General
    S3 is a key-value store
    Key is the name of the object
    Value is the data.
    Version ID is used for versioning.
    Metadata
    Subresources include "Policies", "Access Control Lists", "Cross Origin Resource Sharing" and "Transfer Acceleration".
    
## SLAs
    S3 is designed for 99.99% availability.
    Amazon guarantee 99.9% availability.
    Amazon guarantee 99.(11 9's)% durability.

## Features
    Tiered Storage
    Lifecycle Management

    Encryption
    ACLs and Policies
    
## Storage Tiers

### S3
    99.99% availability
    99.(11 9's)% durability
    Data storage across multiple devices and facilities.
    Designed for loss of 2 facilities.

### S3-IA
    Designed for less frequently accessed data.
    Supports rapid access
    Lower fee but you are charged a retrieval fee.
    
### S3 One Zone IA
    Same as S3-IA but stored on one AZ.
    99.5% availability
    99.(11 9's)% durability
    Cost is 20% less that S3-IA.
    
### Reduced Redundancy Storage
    99.99% availability
    99.99% durability
    For data that can be easily recreated (e.g. thumbnails).
    
### Glacier
    For data that is archived.
    Recovery time is 3-5 hours.
    Very cheap.
    
### S3 Intelligent Tiering
    For data with unknown or unpredictable access pattern.
    2 tiers - Frequent and Infrequent Access
    AWS moves your data to the most cost-effective tier based on how frequently your data is accessed.
    99.9% availability
    99.(11 9's)% durability
    Small fee charged per month for each 1000 objects.
    
## S3 Charges
    Charged per GB
    Charged per requests
    Charged per Tags, Analytics and Inventory(?)
    Charged per download from S3.
    Charged for "Transfer Acceleration".  TA used CloudFront to speed up upload times.
  
## S3 Security
    Buckets are private by default
    "Bucket Policies" applied at bucket level (written in JSON)
    "Access Control Lists" applied at object level.  ACLs describe which accounts/groups have read/write access to objects.
    Buckets can be configured to log all access to a bucket.  Logs are written to another bucket.
    
## S3 Lab
    When creating a bucket, you can click a checkbox taht will retain all versions of each object in this bucket. 
    When creating a bucket, you can optionally select to encrypt your bucket.
    When uploading objects to your bucket, you may select ACLs and the storage class for this object.
    
## S3 Encryption
    Encryption in Transit
      SSL or TLS
      
    Encryption at Rest
      Server side encryption
        S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
          Each object is encrypted with its own key.
          Each key is then encrypted with a master key which is regularly rotated.
        
        AWS Key Management Service or SSE-KMS
          Each object is encrypted with its own key.
          You are then given access to an "envelope" key which is used to encrypt each of the above keys.
          You also get an audit trail to log the use of your "envelope" key.
          You can supply your own key to use as the envelope key, or you may use the default key which Amazon provide.

        Server side encryption with Customer provided keys (SSE-C)
          AWS perform encryption/decryption but you provide the keys.
      
      Client side encryption
        You encrypt the files yourself before uploading them to S3.
        
### Enforcing encryption on S3 buckets
    Files are uploaded to S3 via HTTP PUT requests.
    "Expect: 100-continue" is a header in the PUT request.  This allows S3 to reject the request before the body has been submitted.
    To request a file to be encrypted on upload, the request must include "x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256" or "x-amz-server-side-encryption: ams:kms"
    Your bucket policy may require that each header includes "x-amz-server-side-encryption".
    
## Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
    Allows bucket1 to access resources in bucket2.
    CORS must be enabled on bucket2.
    CORS is enabled by a <CORSConfiguration> block of XML which is applied to bucket2.
    The xml explicitly allows bucket1 to GET bucket2's resources.
